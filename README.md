# Ready to Foster? - Interactive Pet Fostering Assessment Game

Many people want to foster pets, but don't fully understand what daily fostering actually involves.  

This project is designed to help potential foster pet parents assess their readiness for fostering through a simple, interactive game, rather than lengthy forms. It also helps them discover what type of foster animal might be the best match for their lifestyle.

## Overview

This game guides users through a series of questions and real-life-inspired scenarios to evaluate their fostering readiness. Based on their responses, users receive personalized feedback and recommendations for next steps in their fostering journey.

## Development Notes

This project was developed with AI assistance (Claude) to help with specific coding challenges:

**AI was used for:**

- Setting up initial code structure and interaction systems
- Locating where to make custom changes (colors, font sizes, positioning)
- Implementing specific interactive features (rotating badges, animations, hover states)
- Troubleshooting and validating code changes

**We handled independently:**

- All design decisions and visual assets
- Game content (questions, scenarios, feedback text)
- Adding preloaded images and draw functions once the base was established
- Final customizations and refinements
  
Once the foundational code structure was in place, it became easier to understand how different parts connected and make our own modifications. AI was used as a learning tool to understand p5.js patterns and double-check our implementations.
